Abstract:
Have you ever wonder why do you have to call preventDefault() and stopPropagation() so often? What is happening when a user tries to interact with your app? Prepare yourself for deep dive into the world of Events and be surprised because not every Event follows the same path.

Learning objectives:
To fully understand how Events are propagating through the DOM. Not only the standard bubbling phase but the whole path. How to implement simple data emitters using only pure JavaScript? What are the different types of listeners and where is a difference between custom and standard events in JS.
